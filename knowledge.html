        <h1>&ensp;Attack on titan</h1>
        &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;The story revolves around a boy named Eren Yeager, who lives in the town of Shiganshina, located on the edge of Wall Maria, the outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from Titans said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior to the start of the story. 
        In the year 845, the wall is breached by two new types of Titan, named the Colossal (alternatively named the Colossus) and the Armored, and Eren's mother is eaten by a Titan while Eren escapes. 
        He swears revenge on all Titans and enlists in the military along with his childhood friends, Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert.
        During their first battle, Eren learns that he also has the mysterious ability to briefly turn himself into a Titan as well, which draws the attention of the nation's military, which intends to use his newfound power to reclaim Wall Maria. 
        As the battle against the Titans intensifies, Eren and his companions fight to defend their land while uncovering the mysteries about the Titans, their own civilization, and what lies beyond the walls, engaging themselves in a conflict to decide the fate of the entire world.

        <h1>&ensp;Bitcoin</h1>
        &nbsp;&ensp;&ensp;Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto.
        The currency began use in 2009 when its implementation was released as open-source software. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, 
        without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.
        Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. 
        Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. 
        Research produced by the University of Cambridge estimated that in 2017, there were 2.9 to 5.8 million unique users using a cryptocurrency wallet, 
        most of them using bitcoin
